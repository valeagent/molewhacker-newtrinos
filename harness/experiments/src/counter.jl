# Central fairness contract. Every algorithm consumes log_f(theta) only

# ForwardDiff dual-number call increments n_dual_calls by 1 and
# n_grad_partials by the TOTAL number of propagated partials — for a
# flat Dual of chunk size N that is N; for NESTED duals (Hessians via
# gradient-of-gradient) it is the product of the chunk sizes across
# nesting levels (V8-FIX-A6). A dual call adds nothing to n_primal, so
# a complete d-dimensional forward-mode gradient (summed over its
# chunks) costs d, and a full d×d ForwardDiff Hessian costs ≈ d².
#
# Cumulative cost  cost(c) = c.n_primal + c.n_grad_partials.

    LikelihoodCounter{F}

Wraps a primal log-density callable `log_f(::AbstractVector{<:Real}) -> Real`
and tracks calls separately depending on whether the input is plain
`Float64` or a `ForwardDiff.Dual` of chunk size `N`.

Fields
------
- `log_f`             : the underlying callable.
- `n_primal`          : number of primal evaluations (each costs 1).
- `n_dual_calls`      : number of dual-number evaluations.
- `n_grad_partials`   : sum of chunk sizes across dual calls (cost units
                        from automatic differentiation).
- `frozen`            : when true, calls assert.

Cost contract: `cost(c) = c.n_primal + c.n_grad_partials`. A single dual
call with chunk size `N` adds `N` to `n_grad_partials` and nothing to
`n_primal`, so it contributes exactly `N` to the total. A complete
`d`-dimensional forward-mode gradient (summed over however many chunks
ForwardDiff splits it into) therefore costs exactly `d` — matching the
thesis statement "one gradient evaluation is counted as `d`
likelihood-equivalents."

# (the pre-V8 behaviour) undercharged every Hessian d-fold — a full

# `AbstractVector{<:Dual{T,V,N}}` — e.g. the `Vector{Real}` *or*
# `Vector{Any}` container BAT's `PriorToNormal` transform hands the
# target during NUTS leapfrog steps and step-size adaptation — would
# otherwise fall through to the primal branch (or, for `Vector{Any}`,
# match no method at all) and be undercharged at cost 1 instead of cost
# `d`. The signature is deliberately the untyped `AbstractVector` so a
# `Vector{Any}` of duals is still caught; the specialized `Dual` method
# below remains more specific and still wins for statically-typed
# gradient vectors. Inspecting the first element closes the leak

    set_gradient_accounting!(c, n_dual_calls, n_grad_partials)

Authoritatively set the gradient counts, overriding the value-dispatch
tally. Used by the NUTS runner (Coder Brief V6 P0): AdvancedHMC computes
the production leapfrog gradients through an internal cached closure that
bypasses this counter (and even an explicit wrapper on BAT's gradient
function), so the dual-dispatch tally saturates at the warmup count and is
structurally blind to production gradients. The runner instead charges the
*exact* leapfrog count `Σ n_steps` recorded by AdvancedHMC per transition
(`tree.nα`, harvested in `BAT._get_sample_id`; warmup + production) and
installs `n_dual_calls = Σn_steps`, `n_grad_partials = d·Σn_steps` here, so
`cost(c)` reflects the real gradient work — one `d`-dimensional gradient =
`d` cost units. See `docs/NUTS-COST-ACCOUNTING.md`.

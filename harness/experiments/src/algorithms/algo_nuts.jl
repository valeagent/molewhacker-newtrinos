# algo_nuts.jl — NUTS via BAT.HamiltonianMC (Protocol §5.3, §6.1, §6.2, §9.3a)
# =============================================================================
#
# Identity (P0-1, §6.2). `BAT.HamiltonianMC()` with default settings
# configures AdvancedHMC's Leapfrog integrator + GeneralisedNoUTurn
# termination — i.e. the **No-U-Turn Sampler** (Hoffman & Gelman 2014).
# `_verify_nuts_identity()` asserts this at runtime; if a future BAT
# version changes the default the run halts before producing any cell.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gradient cost accounting (Coder Brief V6 P0) — the central fairness axis.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fairness model: one primal log-density evaluation costs 1, one
# d-dimensional gradient costs d (`LikelihoodCounter`, `counter.jl`).
#
# Why the LikelihoodCounter cannot see NUTS's gradients: BAT builds the
# leapfrog gradient with `fg = valgrad_func(f, adsel)` and hands it to
# `AdvancedHMC.Hamiltonian(metric, f, fg)` (BATAdvancedHMCExt
# `_create_proposal_state`). Empirically the counter's dual-dispatch
# tally — and even an explicit wrapper around `fg` — SATURATES at the
# warmup/tuning gradient count (~10^3, independent of how many production
# samples are drawn): AdvancedHMC evaluates the production leapfrog
# gradients through an internally cached closure that calls neither the
# `LikelihoodCounter` nor the BAT-supplied `fg`. So a per-call counter on
# the likelihood is structurally blind to production gradients (the
# `~24k` true gradients vs `n_dual≈967` discrepancy in the brief).
#
# What we charge instead (exact, option (b) of the V6 directive):
# AdvancedHMC records the *actual* number of leapfrog steps per
# transition as `n_steps = tree.nα` (trajectory.jl), which already
# accounts for early U-turn termination — it is exact, not the
# `2^tree_depth − 1` upper bound. BAT's `AHMCSampleID` drops `n_steps`
# (it keeps only `tree_depth`), but `AdvancedHMC.stat(transition)` still
# carries it inside `BAT._get_sample_id`. We intercept that function
# (`_NUTS_NSTEPS` accumulator below) and sum `n_steps` over every
# transition BAT records — `ACCEPTED_SAMPLE`/`REJECTED_SAMPLE` fire
# exactly once per MCMC step (mcmc_state.jl), covering **warmup AND
# production**. After every `bat_sample` we install
# `n_dual_calls = Σn_steps`, `n_grad_partials = d·Σn_steps` via
# `set_gradient_accounting!`, so `cost(counter) = n_primal + d·Σn_steps`
# is the exact gradient-charged budget. See `docs/NUTS-COST-ACCOUNTING.md`.
#
# Budget enforcement (P0-2/P0-4, §6.1) and infeasibility (V6 P0.6).
# Warmup gradients are now charged, and at the smallest budgets BAT's
# minimum warmup plus a single transition can already cost > 1.2·B. Such
# a cell is **budget-infeasible for NUTS**: it is recorded as N/A
# (`terminated_by = :budget_infeasible`, no metrics) rather than padded
# or overshot — an honest, reportable finding. Feasible cells warm up
# once per chain and draw production samples sized to land the realised
# cost in `[0.8, 1.2]·B` (the V6 sanity band).
#
# Chain-major output (P0-3, §9.3a). Production samples from each chain
# are concatenated in chain-major order so that
# `reshape(samples, n_per_chain, nchains)` is well-defined for the
# Gelman–Rubin R̂ implementation in `metrics.jl`.
